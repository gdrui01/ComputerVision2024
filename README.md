# ComputerVision2024

Final project code can be found in the folder `CV2024_final_project`.

The contents of interest are the following:

- `util.py` contains the weiner filter code as well as other helper methods
- `total_variance.py` contains the implementation of the algorithm from [0]
- `kernels.py` helper functions for generating various kernels
- `create_synthetic_data.py` is responsible for creating randomly blurred images for evaluation
